DESCRIPTION:
<br/>
WE HAVE CREATED SECURITY SYSTEM BASED ON FINGERPRINT BIOTECHNIQUE AUTHENTICATION.
<br/>
<br/>

HARDWARE:
<br/>
ARDUINO UNO 
ESP8266
SOLENOID LOCK
MC-38
FINGERPRINT SENSOR
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
PREPARE THE CONTENT 
 README FILES ARE MADE FOR THE DEVLOPERS BUT USER CAL ALSO USE IT. SO WE
 MENTION THE CONTENT OF OUR PROJECT.
 1. WHAT IS ABOUT ?<br/>
     OUR PROJECT IS RELATED TO SECURITY SYSTEM FOR VEHICLES SO WE USE THE FINGERPRINT BIOTECHNIQUE AUTHENTICATION.
     WE MENTION TWO STAGES  OF SECURITY :<br/>
        1) FINGERPRINT AUTHENTICATION <br/>
        2) 2) SEND MESSAGES <br/>
      IF USER PASSES BOTH THE STAGES THEN AND ONLY THEN HE/SHE WILL ABLE TO ACCESS VEHICLES .
      <br/>
      <br/>
 2. WHAT STEPS NEED TO BE TAKEN ? <br/>
    -DO THEY NEED TO INSTALL ANY SOFTWARE ?<br/>
    -IS THERE ANY HARDWARE REQUIREMENT?<br/>
    -AFTER THE INSTALLATION HOW THEY RUN AND COMPILE THE CODE ?<br/>
 3. EXECUTION EXAMPLES <br/>
    - YOU COULD PROVIDE EXAMPLES AND CODE . <br/>
   
   
   INSTALLATION <br/>
    -YOU CAN INSTALL LIBRARY THROUGHT THE ARDUINO LIBRARY MANAGER .<br/>
    - NEVIGATE TO THE MANAGE LIBRARIES OPTION IN THE SKETCH->INCLUDE LIBRARY MENU.<br/>
    -ENTER THE ADAFRUIT IO ARDUINO INTO THE SEARCH BOX , AND CLICK ISTALL ON THE 
    -ADAFRUIT ARDUINO LIBRARY OPTION TO INSTALL VERSION .<br/>
    -ENTER THE ArduinoHttpClient INTO THE SEARCH BOX , AND CLICKINSTALL ON THE ArduinoHttpClient
     library option to install version. <br/>
   
   
   WORKING <br/>
   - WE CAN ADD ADAFRUIT LIBRARY FOR THE ENROLLING FINGERPRINT.<br/>
   - IT CAN CHECK THE FINGERPRINT IF IT IS CORRECT THEN DO FURTHER WORK OTHERWISE NOTHING TO DO .<br/>
   - AFTERTHAT IF IT IS CORRECT THEN IT CAN ABLE TO OPEN THE DOOR.<br/>
   - IF ANYONE OTHER ARE ACCESS THE DOOR THEN IT SHOW MESSAGE THAT"DOOR HAS BEEN OPEN" OTHERWISE NOTHING TO DO.<br/>
   - IF IT IS RIGHT THEN WE ARE ABLE TO ACEES THE VEHICLES . <br/>
